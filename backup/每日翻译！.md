文言文：
- 行当务之事，亦宜分神以探未来之道，扩展格局。凡事皆当立于务实之基，勿拾芝麻而弃西瓜。思维与行事并进，方为成功之要道。学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆。空谈无益，徒不能兴国安邦。
    为谋未来，必先定于当下，然须有远虑方能致长久之计。若止于当下之小利，不虑长远，则必失大机遇。成大事者，不惟知行合一，且持恒定志，贵在有为而思。唯有积累实际经验，方能日渐充实自我，笃行于世而不流于空想。

- While concentrating on current tasks, it is equally important to allocate some energy towards exploring future directions and broadening one’s vision. All efforts must be grounded in the effective management of present affairs—one should not lose sight of overarching goals by becoming preoccupied with trivial matters. The key to success lies in maintaining proactive engagement while also engaging in thoughtful reflection. Learning without contemplation leads to confusion, whereas thinking devoid of learning can result in peril. Mere wishful thinking will not bring about socialism.
    To plan for the future, one must first establish a solid foundation in the present; however, long-term foresight is crucial for sustainable success. Focusing solely on immediate gains while neglecting future prospects may lead to significant missed opportunities. Those who accomplish great things recognize the importance of aligning thought with action, sustaining unwavering determination, and valuing both reflection and practice. Only through accumulating real-world experience can individuals gradually enrich themselves and take meaningful actions, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of idle fantasies.

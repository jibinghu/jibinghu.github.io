文言文：

持志如焚，持行如矢，志不改，行不止。忙时谋略，闲时修德，恒以勤进，方能致远。清心见己，明道识己，自律自强，信心不移。怀热忱以行，负责任以守，志在高远，必有所成。凡事当持大局观，不困于细枝末节，事有所值，皆当尽心竭力。专注于当下之务，行于眼前之道，然心怀远方，不为琐事所累。持之以恒，步步为营，虽难于始，终有所达。行路漫漫，恒心为舟，直抵彼岸，方见光明。

Maintain vitality, stay focused on your goals. In times of busyness, seek solutions with wisdom; in times of leisure, pursue improvement and growth. Steadfast progress is the key to reaching far. Keep a clear mind and know yourself, staying disciplined and confident. With passion to drive you forward, responsibility to guide your actions, and a vision set on something greater, success is inevitable. Commit to every worthwhile endeavor, and see the bigger picture, without being ensnared by trivial details. Stay focused on your immediate goals, act with diligence, yet always keep moving forward. Persistence is the foundation—step by step, even the most challenging journey can be completed. Though the path may be long and winding, with perseverance as your vessel, you will sail to the shores of accomplishment, where the light of success shines bright.

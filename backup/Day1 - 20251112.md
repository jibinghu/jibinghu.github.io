Day 1 – Building a Habit

I will start a new habit from today. On one hand, I want to record my daily life; on the other hand, I hope to share my thoughts on technology and career planning for my future development.

Firstly, the most important thing is my employment situation. The autumn recruitment season is almost over, but because of my lack of knowledge, poor planning, and internship mismatch, I’m still in a passive position. While waiting for the results from Huawei and Honor, I must keep updating my CV and reading recent papers in the latest research fields.

Secondly, in the current AI landscape, infrastructure for end-to-end systems remains crucial. Meanwhile, I’ve noticed the growing importance of multimodal integration and embodied intelligence. My dream city is Nanjing, and I hope that after my hard work, I can find a place to settle there and later pursue a higher degree. My plan for now:

CET-6 preparation — 2 hours per day

Civil service test practice — 2 hours per day

Thirdly, about my health: my stomach problem is improving thanks to soda crackers before meals. However, being overweight and having moderate fatty liver are still challenging for me. At 193 cm and 104 kg, my BMI is around 27.9, so I need to reduce my weight to about 89 kg.
I must avoid refined rice and flour, prioritize vegetables and high-quality protein, and strictly stay away from sugar, fried food, barbecue, and alcohol. Drinking one or two cups of black coffee a day may help reduce the risk of liver fibrosis.
My fat is mainly visceral fat, so I must quit sugary drinks, desserts, milk tea, and juice. Each meal should include only a fist-sized portion of staple food. I also plan to follow intermittent fasting (16:8) and a Mediterranean-style diet.
